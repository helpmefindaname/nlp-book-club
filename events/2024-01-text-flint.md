## Preliminaries/Refreshers

* What does `Robustness` mean in terms of AI/DL/NLP?
* What kinds of Robustness evaluation do you already know or use?

## Introduction

* What are the 3 features provided?
  * What kind of integrity is provided? Which languages are supported and how can existing transformations be extended for a better evaluation?
  * How is acceptability guaranteed?
  * How is analyzability provided by the framework?

* How many models were evaluated?
* What findings towards the robustness of models are conducted?

## TextFlint Framework

* How is the input layer designed?
* What are the 3 types supported in the Generation Layer?
* Looking at **Figure 3** what are the types of Transformations? Are there any types that are not intuitively explainable by their name?
* What kind of Subpopulations are provided?
* What is meant by Attack Receipts?
* What metrics can be used for Validators?

## Usage

* What are the essential parts of the json Config?
* How is the usage via CLI or Python API?
* How is a model loaded via the config?
* What is the required dataset format?
* How does the *General Evaluation* use case work? What findings do we see in **Figure 5**?
* How does the *Target Model Improvement* use case work?

## Benchmarking Existing Models with TextFlint

* How was evaluated if the generated examples are still valid?
* Is the evaluation of the models still accessible?

## Related Work

* What other tools for *Robustness Evaluation* are mentioned?
* What tools for *Interpretatbility and Error analysis* are mentioned?

## Conclusion and final thoughts

* How multilingual is TextFlint? How hard would it be to add support for other Indo-European languages?
* What limitations do you find within that tool?
* Can you imagine using this tool in a project?
* How many stars does their Github have?
* What references did you find interesting?
